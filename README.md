# Description
ALTK is a application that helps you insert unicode characters through macroses without changing your input method.
ALTK uses numpad number keys (Numpad0, Numpad1 .. Numpad9) to insert decimal number and NumpadPlus key to convert the input into a character.

It can be illustrated so:
```
some text, (user presses Numpad9, Numpad5, Numpad5, NumpadPlus in a order)Î» blah blah
```

# Usage
1. You need to disable the numpad keys, you can use this shell script for this:
```
for i in 90 87 88 89 83 84 85 79 80 81 86; do
  xmodmap -e "keycode $i = "
done
```
2. Simply run the application.
3. Gratz, enjoy.
